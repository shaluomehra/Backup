# What is Git?

Git is a distributed version control system that helps developers track changes in their code and collaborate with others. It allows you to save snapshots (called "commits") of your project at different points in time.

## Snapshots, Not Differences

The major difference between  Git and other VCS is that sees the datta differently. <br>
GIT takes a "snapshot" of the file instead of updating every version all the time

## The Three States in Git
- Modified: This state indicates that you have made changes to a file, but these changes have not yet been saved to your database through a commit. <br>

- Staged: In this state, you have identified a modified file in its current state to be included in the next snapshot when you make a commit.<br>

- Committed: When a file is in this state, it means that the data is securely stored in your local database, forming a permanent part of your project's history.<br>
